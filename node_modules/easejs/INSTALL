GNU ease.js may be used directly from the distribution archive available on
the [website](https://www.gnu.org/software/easejs/download.html).  All
versions, including previous versions as far back as 0.2.0, are available on
[ftp.gnu.org](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/easejs/).

Alternatively, you may install ease.js using npm for use with Node.js or
io.js by issuing the following command:

  $ npm install easejs

To install globally, use the `-g` flag.

To build from source, see `Configuring' below.


Configuring
===========
If your distribution contains a `configure` file in the project root, you
may immediately run `./configure`.

Otherwise, you likely have the sources as they exist in the project
repository, which does not contain the generated `configure` script; you
may generate it by issuing the following command:

  $ ./autogen.sh

Please note that certain files (such as `AUTHORS`, `NEWS`, and `ChangeLog`)
are generated as part of the `dist` target and do not exist as part of the
repository.  To build them, run `make` on the appropriate target.


Building
========
After running `./configure`, ease.js may be used by `require`'ing the path
using Node.js or io.js.

To build the distribution files (found in `build/` in the distributions),
run `make distdir`.  To create the distribution tarball, run `make dist`.
To build only the combined files and the browser test page, run `make
combine`; to create the minified files, run `make min`.  Each of these are
included in the distribution.

To run all tests, run `make test`.  To run the tests in the browser, make
any of the above targets and load `tools/browser-test.html` in your web
browser.
