     * virtual as appropriate, and retain only that reference for use from

     * This was a subtle bug that creeped up in a class that was derived

     * (which are of course public), which the class was also manipulating.
     * Unfortunately, the class was manipulating a property of a same name
     * on the private visibility object, whereas the prototype instance was
     * manipulating it on the public. Therefore, the value of the property
     * varied depending on whether you asked the class instance or the
     * prototype instance that it inherited. Yikes.
     *
     * The root issue of this was even more subtle: the parent method (that
     * does the manipulation) was invoked, meaning that it was executed
     * within the context of the private visibility object, which is what
     * caused the issue. However, this issue is still valid regardless of
     * whether a parent method is called.
     *
     * Mitigating this is difficult, so we settle for a combination of good
     * guessing and user education. We assume that all non-function fields
     * set on the object (its own fields---not the prototype chain) by the
     * constructor  are public and therefore need to be proxied, and so
     * implicitly declare them as such. Any remaining properties that are
     * set on the object (e.g. set by methods but not initialized in the
     * ctor) will need to be manually handled by declaring them as public in
     * the class. We test the first case here.
