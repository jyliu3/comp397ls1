     * couple months.
     *
     * Proxying to an overridden protected method was not a problem because
     * it proxies to the protected member object (PMO) which is passed into

     * prototype provides only the public API.
     *
     * This test ensures that we properly access the protected API of our
     * supertype. This problem existed before any general solution to this
     * problem for all subtypes. We test public as well to produce a more
     * general test case.
     *
     * The second part of this test is implicit---we're testing multiple
     * virtual methods to ensure that they return distinct results, ensuring
     * that we don't have any variable reassignment issues in the loop that
     * generates the closures.
