This directory contains the performance tests. These tests contain basic
routines that perform a single action and output the result in seconds, with a
basic description of what has been done. The timing is done via the native Date
object to ensure that it can be run both server and client-side.

It is important that each test performs only a single operation to ensure that
the prior operations have no consequences on the previous, at least when run
server-side by invoking a separate executable for each.
