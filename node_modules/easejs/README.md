GNU ease.js is a classical object-oriented framework for Javascript,
intended to eliminate boilerplate code and "ease" the transition into
JavaScript from other object-oriented languages.

Current support includes:

* Simple and intuitive class definitions
* Classical inheritance
* Traits as mixins
* Access modifiers (public, protected, and private)
* Abstract classes and methods
* Interfaces
* Static and constant members
* Transparent error subtyping


## Documentation
Comprehensive documentation and examples are available on the [GNU
ease.js](https://www.gnu.org/software/easejs) website and in its
[manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/easejs/manual).


## Bug Reports / Feature Requests
Please direct bug reports and feature requests to bug-easejs@gnu.org or the
[project page on Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/easejs).


## Why Classical OOP in JavaScript?
GNU ease.js was created (historically) for a number of reasons:

* To "ease" object-oriented developers into JavaScript by providing a
  familiar environment.
* To provide the maintenance and development benefits of classical OOP.
* To provide features not included in the language, such as proper
  encapsulation through private/protected members, interfaces, traits,
  intuitive inheritance, and other conveniences.
* To encapsulate the hacks commonly used to perform the above tasks.

Many JS purists believe that classical object-oriented programming should be
left out of JavaScript and that one should stick strictly to prototypal
development. While the two are related (they are both object-oriented), they
can be applied to different problem domains in order to achieve results that
are more natural or intuitive to developers; GNU ease.js works seamlessly
with existing prototypes, allowing the developer to choose whether or not
they want to use "classes".


## Building and Installation
For information on installing ease.js on your system, see
[`INSTALL`](./INSTALL).  Alternatively, you may install the software using
npm by issuing the following command:

```
$ npm install easejs
```

## Configuring
If your distribution contains a `configure` file in the project root, you
may jump immediately to [`INSTALL`](./INSTALL).

Otherwise, you likely have the sources as they exist in the project
repository, which does not contain the generated `configure' script; you
may generate it by issuing the following command:

```
$ autoreconf -fvi
```

Please note that certain files (such as AUTHORS, NEWS, and ChangeLog) are
generated as part of the `dist` target and do not exist as part of the
repository.


## Hacking
